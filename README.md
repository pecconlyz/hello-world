My first repository

My third commit

__My name is **Prince Cris** and i'm  currently learning the ropes of github.__
__I have been learning **_Python_** for quite some time now, before i was advised by a mentor to learn __Javascript__.__
___After learning vannilla javascript, the next step is to go into MERN or MEAN,but i will decide before then.
I will learn to merge my python and javascript project, to create greater projects.
But i'm still a beginner anyways.
I like *Javascript* so far and i hope to build great things with it.___
