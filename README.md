# hello-world

My first repository

My second commit

My name is **Prince Cris** and i'm  currently learning the ropes of github.
I have been learning **_Python_** for quite some time now, before i was advised by a mentor to learn __Javascript__.
After learning vannilla javascript, the next step is to go into MERN or MEAN,[i  will decide before then.].
I will learn to merge my python and javascript project, to create greater projects.
But i'm still a beginner anyways.<ehcjkhsdvkjhf>
I like *Javascript* so far and i hope to build great things with it.
